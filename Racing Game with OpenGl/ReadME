We implemented the application in a different way than suggested :
The car translation was apply to the track instead of the car.
Therefore it implied that we  didn't have to translate the camera,
and the spotlight.
For the car collision implementation, we applied a translation to the car spheres
only and checked if there is a collision.
As mentioned in the Homework, there is still a bit error, due to the bounding sphere
accuracy.
For the other distances, we didn't choose some accurate distances from the camera to the
car.
In the whole implementation, we improved one by one the translation to get the best result possible.
